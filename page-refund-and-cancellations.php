                <h4>OUR CANCELLATION OR CHANGE OF ENROLMENT POLICIES</h4>
                <p>TechyEdz Solutions offers a Refund Policy which is Fair and Equitable</p>
                <p>Upon enrolling in a course with any educational institution a student is entering a legal agreement under common law, in which they agree to abide by the conditions of enrolment (including meeting stated payments), in exchange for the service offered by the institution in the delivery of the course.</p>
                <p>In a situation where a student wishes to cancel or change their enrolment, and as a measure of goodwill, ADL will allow the following options. A student may only take up one of these options once.</p>
                <p>Please read the following options:</p>
                <p>Within 14 days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a period of 14 days from enrolment, a full refund will be given on the total amount of tuition fees paid at the time of cancellation. The student must notify the Academyâ€™s administration department in writing and the letter be received within the 14 day period, either by fax, email, mail or delivered in person</li>
                    <li>f you apply for a refund after 14 days our refund policy does not apply. However, you will have the option to change your course to another without incuring additional charges</li>
                    <li>The onus is on the student to ensure and confirm that written notification of withdrawal is lodged</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If course notes have already been sent to the student; they must be returned before the refund is paid.</p>
                <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Every attempt is made to ensure all information from the academy is accurate and that the student has attained the competencies taught in a course, at the point of their assessment. Beyond this point, the graduate is responsible to maintain their acquired competencies, and apply acquired knowledge and skills in a way which is appropriate to the unique characteristics of each application. This will release the school from any liability, action and claims of whatsoever nature in connection with, or arising from any such information, instruction or advice, given by any student or ex-student, whether directions given during the course are followed or not.</p>
